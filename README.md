# ACHP-Aqua-Cooler

Due to the IP reason, I cannot put the full code here, so this is a fork section for the original open-source ACHP source. 

ACHP-Aqua-Cooler:
ACHP-Aqua-Cooler is an in-house project for an Australian company called Aqua Cooler and its parent company Imaging Solutions. 
On top of the original ACHP program, I changed it to an industrial chiller-specific simulation software. 
The project involved converting thermal dynamic concepts into Python code. The process mainly involved properties of different refrigerants, metal properties and fluid dynamics in the industrial chiller.  

New features include:
- Compressor variable speed drive
- Hot gas bypass
- Shell and tube heat exchanger
- Coil in tank heat exchanger
- Fin and tube heat exchanger

I also created a new software for the fin and tube heat exchanger on top of ACHP-Aqua-Cooler. 

ACHP:
ACHP is a Python-based air conditioning and heat pump system model v1.5
This version uses CoolProp v6.x
